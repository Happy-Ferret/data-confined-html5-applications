Data Confined HTML5 Applications
================================

Code Release for our ESORICS 2013 Paper "Data-confined HTML5 Applications".

The firefox-modifications folder contains our patches to Firefox along with a
modified build.  The dcfattribute patch adds support for a dcfsandbox
attribute. The blockclientside patch disables client-side cross-origin channels
for data-confined sandboxes. The monitor is implemented via an extension, which
is the xpi file in the firefox-modifications folder.

The casestudie folder contains all our case studies. Read the full paper for details.
