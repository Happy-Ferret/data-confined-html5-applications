This is a modified version of BrowserID, based on revision
1ba11c235dd1424c6f3efb876c58964d98b30423.

To set up this case study, you will need node.js and npm (npm is
included with newer versions of node.js). follow steps 1 and 2 in
"Running BrowserID Locally" in README.md. This doesn't seem to work
even in the original version, so here are some tips:

- If npm can't install bcrypt, you might need g++
- If jwcrypto complains about missing cryptographic scripts, run
  node_modules/jwcrypto/libs/load.sh
- If a "minimal.js" is missing, run
  node_modules/jwcrypto/libs/package.sh
- If a "bidbundle.js" is missing, run
  node_modules/jwcrypto/bundle.sh
- You might need node-uglify
- If a "root.cert" has only one part, delete it and run
  scripts/generate_ephemeral_keys.sh

We did not test email verification. To create some test accounts, run
the server with a CREATE_TEST_USERS environment variable. The
following example creates a user with email address
<1@loadtest.domain> and password "THE PASSWORD"

CREATE_TEST_USERS=1 npm start
